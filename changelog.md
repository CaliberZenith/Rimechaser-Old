##### These changelogs start from the initial commit.

# Push 1: The frost mourns for warmth.

## Items

- Added the *`Ancient Rime`* item. "Holy mother of god, that took longer to figure out." ~ Misha
- Added the *`Ancient Rime Block`* item. "Hmmmmm..." ~ Misha

## Cleanups:

- Added this changelog that replaces the forge changelog from the inital commit and MDK.
- Removed the random spaces added for neatness. But it just ended up being messier.
- Cleaned up *`AncientRime.java`*
- Cleaned up *`AncientRimeBlock.java`*
- Cleaned up improper directories.
- Removed a few other files of no note.

## Updates:

- Updated the *`gitingore`*
- Changed *`TileEntityTypeInit`* to *`BlockEntityTypeInit`*
- Updated the *`LICENSE.txt`* to reflect the license used in the mod.

## Textures:

- Added the *`Ancient Rime`* Texture and Json file.


## Other Changes:

- Added a *`@SubscribeEvent`* to the *`frostedOver`* method.
- Added the *`blockitems`* and *`items`* packages, to differentiate between the two. "Well, I'm clearly daft, so I need this." ~ Misha
- Added the *`en_us.lang`* file.
- Replaced the *`changelog.txt`* from Forge to *`changelog.md`* that documents my changes.
    

### Note(s):

- "I should probably change the *`readme.txt`* to my own *`readme.md`*" ~ Misha
- "Probably clean up the *`Init`* classes too." ~ Misha


# Push 2: Eclectic Boogaloo

## Blocks:

- Added a few more properties to the `Ancient Rime` block.

## Updates:

- Added the `ancient_rime_block.json` inside `rimechaser:blockstates`

## Other Changes:

- Added the `rimechaser:blockstates` directory. "It was missing, that's why the block wasn't showing the textures." ~ Misha

## Note(s):

- "God, I'm losing my edge." ~ Misha
- "Remember: Add Variants to the `Ancient Rime Block` and fix the texture for consistency." ~ Misha
- "Next commit, I have to add the tool types for the blocks... First have to figure out how though." ~ Misha
